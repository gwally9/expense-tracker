### 3. **Heroku** (with caveats)

## **Ultra-Cheap Options ($1-5/month)**

### 4. **PythonAnywhere**
- **Cost**: $5/month for always-on apps

## **Recommended Approach for Your App**

I'd suggest **Render (Free)** or **Railway ($5)** because:

1. **Simple deployment process**
2. **Integrated database**
3. **Automatic SSL certificates**
4. **Git-based deployments**

## **Quick Setup for Render (Free)**

Here's how to deploy your app on Render:## **Deployment Steps for Render (Free)**

1. **Prepare your code:**
   - Add the files above to your project
   - Update `app.py` with the PostgreSQL-compatible version
   - Push to GitHub

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Choose "Web Service"
   - Use these settings:
     - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
     - **Add PostgreSQL database** (free tier)

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Render will auto-set `DATABASE_URL`
   - Set `SECRET_KEY` (Render can generate this)

## **Cost Comparison Summary**

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Database | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|----------|------|------|
| **Render** | Free | Free PostgreSQL | Easy setup, persistent storage | Sleeps after 15min |
| **Railway** | $5 | Included | No sleep, great DX | Not free |
| **PythonAnywhere** | $5 | MySQL included | Python-focused | Limited features |
| **Heroku** | $7 | $5 extra | Mature platform | Expensive |
| **DigitalOcean** | $5 | $15 or SQLite | Reliable | Complex setup |

## **My Recommendation**

**Start with Render (Free)** because:
- Zero cost to begin
- Built-in PostgreSQL database
- Easy GitHub integration
- Can upgrade later if needed
- Perfect for personal spending tracker

The 15-minute sleep limitation won't matter much for a personal expense tracker since you'll likely use it actively when adding expenses.

If you need 24/7 availability later, upgrade to Railway ($5/month) which offers excellent value without the sleep limitation.
